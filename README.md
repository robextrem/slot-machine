## Technology Used üõ†Ô∏è

This project was built using the following technologies:

- PIXI.js: To manage assets designed with Spine.
- ~~Babylon.js: For buttons and scene manager.~~
- Gsap: To manage tweening.
- TypeScript: Main programming language.
- Prettier & ESlint: Code quality and formatting.
- Vite: A build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience by leveraging native ES modules in modern browsers. It includes features such as hot module replacement (HMR), which allows for instant updates to the browser as you make changes to your code.
